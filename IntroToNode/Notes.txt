Notes:

 // global objects
 //we can access it anywehre in any files

console.log();

setTimeout();   //use tis to call a function after a delay, standard JS
clearTimeout(); 

setInterval();  //use this to repetatively call a function after a given delay
clearInterval();

in browsers we have the window objects

all functions above are part of the window objects

if we make:
    var message = '';
    window.message //is another way of calling it

local variables are not added to the global variables 

for instance:
    var message = '';
    console.log(global.message); //will return an undefined error message

local variables are restricted to the current file due to nodes modual system

every node application has at least one node/file that we call the main module
